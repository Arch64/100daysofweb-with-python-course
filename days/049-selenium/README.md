# Day 49 Selenium

As we have only one day for this miscellaneous topic, watching the videos should suffice.

In this lesson we will test [PyBites My Reading List](https://pybitesbooks.com) Django app.

If you want to follow along with my code, consider [creating an account](https://pybitesbooks.com/accounts/register/) and setting your username and password in an `.env` file (make sure you hide this file from version control!).

```
$ cp .env-template .env

# set USERNAME and PASSWORD variables to yours
```

The starter code can be found in the [start subdirectory](start), the final code is [here](final).
